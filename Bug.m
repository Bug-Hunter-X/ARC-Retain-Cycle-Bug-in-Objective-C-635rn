In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with memory management and the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and manual memory management using techniques like `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.  Specifically, the improper use of `retain` within a method that's part of a larger object lifecycle can lead to unexpected retain cycles and memory leaks.  Consider a scenario where a method in class `A` retains an instance of class `B`, and a method in class `B` retains an instance of class `A`. If neither releases the other, a circular reference is created, preventing objects from being deallocated even when no longer actively used.
